HockeyStatsExtractor
====================
Stats Extractor For Hockey. Alpha build 0.2

Bugs and issues guaranteed until the release version.

--------------------

Update March 12 2014: A high number of bugs are caused by the fact that the hockey.exe application overwrites player data when a player leaves the server and another one joins. This leads to crashes when the part that handles the +/- tries to access a player whose name has been changed.

A partial rewrite is in order to have more maintaiable code and tone down the level of spaghetti-code and fatal bugs.
